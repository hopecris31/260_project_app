# Project 3 CSC-260 Spring Term 2023

## Project Backlog Scrum Web Application

## Description
The Project Backlog Scrum Web Application is a sophisticated multi-user platform
designed to streamline and enhance the process of creating and managing Project Backlogs
for Senior Research. This cutting-edge application enables users to effortlessly
create and organize Project Backlog items while providing a seamless interface to view
and collaborate on other students' project backlogs within their designated groups.

With this application, users can easily set goals and break them down into tasks,
creating a comprehensive and structured project backlog. The intuitive interface allows
users to seamlessly create sprints from project backlog items, track task completion within
each sprint, and activate a single sprint at a time. By incorporating an efficient and
organized goal planning system, the application ensures optimal productivity and effective
project management.

## Usage
This sophisticated web application is specifically tailored to meet the needs of CSC-497 Students and their Professors during their Senior Research projects. 
By offering a range of features for efficient, organized, and time-sensitive planning, this application revolutionizes the way Project Backlogs are managed,
providing an invaluable tool for academic success.

## Meet the Team
The success of this project is credited to the exceptional talents and contributions of our dedicated team:

- Claudia Porto
- Hope Crisafi
- Yuxing Liu

## Project Requirements
The Project Backlog Scrum Web Application encompasses several essential requirements to cater to the needs of both professors and students during Senior Research projects. These requirements include:

- Ability for professors to add students
- Formation of student groups by professors
- Comprehensive visibility for professors, allowing them to access all students' project backlogs and sprint information
- Interactive commenting system for professors and a student's team members to provide feedback on sprint reviews
- Access for students to view project backlogs and sprint information for their team members (with restrictions on editing)
- For a student's own project backlog:
  * Adding, editing, and deleting project backlog items
  * Selection of backlog items for sprints
  * Specification of task lists for backlog items
  * Recording of progress on selected tasks during sprints
  * Reflection entry at the conclusion of a sprint

## Fantastic Design Layout
The Project Backlog Scrum Web Application boasts a visually stunning and highly intuitive design layout. It has been meticulously crafted to ensure effortless navigation, user-friendly interactions, and a visually pleasing experience. The application's design prioritizes aesthetics and user experience, emphasizing the importance of intuitive interfaces and visually appealing elements to enhance user engagement.

## Project Status
Our branch, called Best Version, is our best working version that our hard-working team was able to complete under this time constraint. We had troubles with the SQL Database working alongside our
Web Application, so in our repository we have our main branch with the SQL Database and queries working in each method, and Best Version
omits the use of the SQL Database to see how our design was functional, and easy to navigate. However, in the main branch
we were able to get SQL working to access the different scenes based on the selection in the login window (that's a start!).

Although we were determined to finish implementing the SQL Database, we were unable to do so and therefore
plan on adding that functionality into our Release 3! 

At the moment we are planning on fixing the issues below to be functional in Release 3:
* Students cannot edit or delete a task in the Project Backlog
* The group tab in the Student view does not open 
  * This does not allow for Students to comment on the Sprints of other students in their groups
* Professor can view the page that would work to view a Students Backlog and Sprints, however no information
  will appear due to the SQL Database functionality not working, and therefore they are unable to comment
  on the selected Students Sprint
* Model Class Constructors with SQL not functional

## Future Work
In addition to the existing features and functionalities, we have exciting plans for future enhancements to elevate the capabilities of the Project Backlog Scrum Web Application in Release 3. The future developments include:

- Advanced analytics for professors to gain valuable insights into students' progress, such as:
  * Monitoring the frequency of student check-ins and updates on sprint progress
  * Identifying groups/students that are consistently completing or failing to complete their sprint reviews
  * Tracking the progress of each completed sprint and overall project backlog progress
- Integration of multi-class administration functionality, empowering professors to administer multiple classes effortlessly
- Implementation of automated notifications to alert users when comments are made on their work, fostering seamless collaboration and timely feedback
- Integration of reminder notifications to ensure timely completion of check-ins and sprint reviews, optimizing project workflow and time management
- Fixing all issues encountered in Release 2!

## Acknowledgements
A big thank you goes out to NLP Queen CS Girlboss, Kristina Striegnitz. You are so amazing and we would not have
made it through 151, 483, and 260 (and 497) without you! We will forever remember this class and how willing you were
to help us with even the smallest of problems (or huge problems). Your patience is unparalleled. Thank you so much!!!
